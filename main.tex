\noindent{\bf Abstract}

\textit{This abstract should eventually be between 125-150 words long and the paper itself must be between 5 and 10 pages long.}

\section*{Background}
Here we will talk about the background of data collection via questionnaires which exported CSV and were then loaded into a relational database through some ETL process.  Need to cite examples from various papers, shouldn't be too hard to find.
\todo{Joseph to write}

Now we talk about the challenges around this approach, especially hitting on the inflexibility of schema changes and difficulty of sharing and comparing data from this process. Again citations related to challenges people have faced shouldn't be too difficult to find.

\section*{Another Way Forward}
Outline the basic premise of representing the answers to questions with RDF directly.

\textcolor{red}{What level of familiarity with the semantic web should we assume?}
\textcolor{red}{JB: The AMIA 2016 proceedings are over 2000 pages long, and have only four papers that mention "semantic web." So it's not all that common. But a paragraph should be enough.}

Explain the basics of the semantic web, hopefully inside of a single paragraph.
\textcolor{red}{Maybe this paragraph should go before we recommend using the semantic web to represent questions and answers.}

\section*{How to Represent Questions}
Mathias should write this section about the \emph{proper} method of representing the answer to a question in RDF. We can use a few examples here from CAFE or DIDEO.

\section*{Advantages Over Previous Methods}
Expand upon the problems with previous methods and extol the virtues of our method.

Talk about the idea of representing what a question is actually asking as opposed to just recording that the respondent answered Yes to question 1 or False to question 4.

Having to codify in RDF what a question is asking can also help you correctly word your questions by really thinking about what the question is asking.

\section*{Problems and Limitations}
Does this merit an entire section, or just a few sentences in the conclusion.

\section*{Our Implementations}
Lots of screen shots and example of use from CAFE and DIDEO.
Show off a few examples of the output from DIDEO or the full RDF graph from a single run of the CAFE trauma center questionnaire.

Maybe mention semantic survey here, or would that be better for future work?

\section*{Conclusion}
The way \emph{you've} been doing things is wrong, our way is right.
