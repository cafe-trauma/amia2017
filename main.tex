\noindent{\bf Abstract}

\textit{Abstract text goes here, justified and in italics.  The abstract would normally be one paragraph long.  See Table 1. for appropriate abstract length by submission type.}

\section*{Background}
Here we will talk about the background of data collection via questionnaires which exported CSV and were then loaded into a relational database through some ETL process.  Need to cite examples from various papers, shouldn't be too hard to find.

Now we talk about the challanges around this approach, especially hitting on the inflexibility of schema changes and difficulty of sharing and comparing data from this process. Again citations related to challenges people have faced shouldn't be too difficult to find.

\section*{Another Way Forward}
Outline the basic premise of representing the answers to questions with RDF directly.
